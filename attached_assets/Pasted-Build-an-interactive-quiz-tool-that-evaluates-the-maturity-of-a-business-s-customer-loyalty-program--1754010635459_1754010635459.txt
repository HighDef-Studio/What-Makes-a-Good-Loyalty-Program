Build an interactive quiz tool that evaluates the maturity of a business’s customer loyalty program. The quiz is based on a structured checklist organized into eight categories. Each item within these categories has a descriptive label, an explanatory description (used as a tooltip or expandable text), and a backend-only weighted point value. Users will indicate whether each feature is currently deployed by selecting yes or no.

Each "yes" selection should contribute its associated weighted point value (invisible to the user) toward the total score. The quiz should calculate both an overall maturity score and a detailed breakdown by category.

Core Functional Requirements:

1. Quiz Structure:
   - Present the checklist in 8 logical sections:
     - Customer-Centric Approach
     - Engagement & Communication
     - Data Utilization & Analytics
     - Referrals & Social Sharing
     - Flexibility & Adaptability
     - Attractive Rewards
     - Exceptional Customer Service
     - Multi-Channel Accessibility
   - Each section contains multiple items.
   - Each item includes:
     - A checkbox input
     - A title (label)
     - A description (available on hover or expand)
     - A weighted point value (used for backend calculations only, hidden from users)

2. Scoring Logic:
   - For each item marked “yes,” add the corresponding weighted point value to the running total.
   - Calculate:
     - Total maturity score = (sum of selected weights ÷ total available weights) × 100
     - Individual category score = (sum of selected weights in that category ÷ total category weights) × 100
   - Round all percentages to the nearest whole number.

3. Category-Level Feedback:
   - For each of the 8 categories, always display:
     - The name of the category
     - The score percentage for that category
     - A short summary of what this score represents
     - 1–2 tailored recommendations for improving or maintaining performance in that category
   - If a category score is below 60%, it may be labeled or styled as “underperforming,” but feedback should still be shown for all categories regardless of score.

4. Overall Score Feedback:
   - After the category breakdown, display the total maturity score (percentage).
   - Based on that total score, display one of four overall program summaries:
     - 85% and above:
       - “Your loyalty program is highly mature and well-structured. Focus on fine-tuning and personalization to stay competitive.”
     - 70% to 84%:
       - “You have a strong foundational loyalty framework. Optimize communication cadence, staff alignment, and reward variety to maximize ROI.”
     - 50% to 69%:
       - “You are building loyalty momentum. Prioritize areas like digital integration, referral strategies, and streamlined customer experience.”
     - Below 50%:
       - “Your loyalty program is at an early stage. Start with essentials like sign-up simplicity, rewards visibility, and consistent messaging.”

5. Final Output:
   - Display:
     - Total maturity score
     - Table or list of each category with:
       - Score percentage
       - Summary feedback
       - Actionable recommendations
     - Overall maturity message based on total score range
     - Optional: list of top 3 recommended next steps across all categories
