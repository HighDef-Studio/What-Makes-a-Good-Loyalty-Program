Build an interactive quiz tool that evaluates the maturity of a business’s customer loyalty program. The quiz is based on a structured checklist organized into eight categories. Each item within these categories has a descriptive label, an explanatory description (used as a tooltip or expandable text), and a backend-only weighted point value. Users will indicate whether each feature is currently deployed by selecting yes or no.

Each "yes" selection should contribute its associated weighted point value (invisible to the user) toward the total score. The quiz should calculate both an overall maturity score and a detailed breakdown by category.

Core Functional Requirements:

1. Quiz Structure:

   * Present the checklist in 8 logical sections:

     * Customer-Centric Approach
     * Engagement & Communication
     * Data Utilization & Analytics
     * Referrals & Social Sharing
     * Flexibility & Adaptability
     * Attractive Rewards
     * Exceptional Customer Service
     * Multi-Channel Accessibility
   * Each section contains multiple items.
   * Each item includes:

     * A checkbox input
     * A title (label)
     * A description (available on hover or expand)
     * A weighted point value (used for backend calculations only, hidden from users)

2. Scoring Logic:

   * For each item marked “yes,” add the corresponding weighted point value to the running total.
   * Calculate:

     * Total maturity score = (sum of selected weights ÷ total available weights) × 100
     * Individual category score = (sum of selected weights in that category ÷ total category weights) × 100
   * Round all percentages to the nearest whole number.

3. Category-Level Feedback:

   * For each of the 8 categories, always display:

     * The name of the category
     * The score percentage for that category
     * A short summary of what this score represents
     * 1–2 tailored recommendations for improving or maintaining performance in that category
   * If a category score is below 60%, it may be labeled or styled as “underperforming,” but feedback should still be shown for all categories regardless of score.

4. Overall Score Feedback:

   * After the category breakdown, display the total maturity score (percentage).
   * Reference the attached scoring matrix document for detailed advice and logic based on total score ranges.

5. Final Output:

   * Present a summary screen with the following components:

     * Total maturity score (as a percentage)
     * A category breakdown table or list showing:

       * The score percentage for each of the 8 categories
       * Whether it is considered underperforming (if below 60%)
       * Summary feedback and improvement recommendations for each category
     * A general overall summary based on the user's total score (sourced from the attached scoring matrix)
     * A list of 2–3 overall recommendations pulled from weak categories to guide next steps
     * Optional: export/download/share capability for report
